# Web Scraping and Visualization of Rental Data in Geneva(Switzerland) with Python


This part is extracted from project "Analysis on Apartment rental prices between Switzerland and USA Markets" realized as a part my master studies in HSLU (Lucerne University of Applied Sciences) in collaboration with Aleksandra Bundovska (aleksandra.bundovska@stud.hslu.ch) and Yang Bai (yang.bai@stud.hslu.ch). 

In this article, I explain how you can:

- Get the rental data by web scraping and converting it to Pandas data frame
- Use the Geopandas library to convert maps which are in shapefile to Geopandas data frames and Geojson maps
- Make interactive Choropleth maps embedded with rental data, which looks like this (hover over the map to see average rent per room for each zip-code):
