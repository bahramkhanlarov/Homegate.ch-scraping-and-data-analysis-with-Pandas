# Web Scraping and Visualization of Rental Data in Geneva(Switzerland) with Python


This part is extracted from project "Analysis on Apartment rental prices between Switzerland and USA Markets" realized as a part my master studies in HSLU (Lucerne University of Applied Sciences) in collaboration with Aleksandra Bundovska (aleksandra.bundovska@stud.hslu.ch) and Yang Bai (yang.bai@stud.hslu.ch). 

In this article, I explain how you can:

- Get the rental data by web scraping and converting it to Pandas data frame
- Use the Geopandas library to convert maps which are in shapefile to Geopandas data frames and Geojson maps
- Make interactive Choropleth maps embedded with rental data, which looks like this:

## 1. Web Scraping for rental data

If available, it is easier/recommended to use an API (similar to twitter, reddit APIs) . However, most of the websites don't have public APIs or if they have they provide very limited public access. In such cases, web scraping might be necessary.

This was the case for me when I wanted to study rental data in Geneva. So, I decided to develop my own web crawler to get the data for analysis (not any business purposes) from Immoscout24.ch. Below I explain this web crawler. You can find the corresponding Jupyter notebook <ins>[here](https://github.com/bkhan1820/Homegate.ch-scraping-and-data-analysis-with-Pandas/blob/Master/Homegate-Geneva%20scraping%20code.ipynb)</ins>.

First step is to download the web html pages. For instance, for city of Geneva this is how you could do it:
